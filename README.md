My solutions to the advent of code 2023 challenge.

| Day | Solution                       | Comment                                                                                              |

|  1  | [day 1 solution](day1/day1.py) | It was tricky to realize that the words had to be parsed secuentially to transform them into digits. |
|  2  | [day 2 solution](day2/day2.py) |                                                                                                      |
|  3  | [day 3 solution](day3/day3.py) | Part two was significantly easier to solve once I remembered `dict` exists.                          |
|  3  | [day 3 solution](day4/day4.py) | Part two maybe is not the most optimal way to do it.                                                 |
