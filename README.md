|  [1](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/1)  | [day 1 solution](day1/day1.py) | It was tricky to realize that the words had to be parsed secuentially to transform them into digits. |
|  [2](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/2)  | [day 2 solution](day2/day2.py) |                                                                                                      |
|  [3](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/3)  | [day 3 solution](day3/day3.py) | Part two was significantly easier to solve once I remembered `dict` exists.                          |
|  [4](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/4)  | [day 4 solution](day4/day4.py) | Part two maybe is not the most optimal way to do it.                                                 |
| [5](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/5)  | [day 5 solution](day5/day5.py) |                                                                                                      |
